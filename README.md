# Event Tracker

This is the same as Event Tracker but uses ReduxSimpleStarter instead of React Slingshot.  I really like
React Slingshot but ReduxSimpleStarter is less complicated so I decided to get it working with it first.

Event Tracker is an application for tracking events with a group.  For example, a family can use it to have a central place
for everyone to enter and see upcoming events.

## Technologies Used
*  React and Redux
*  [ReduxSimpleStarter](https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter)
*  Google Maps
*  [Big Calendar](http://intljusticemission.github.io/react-big-calendar/examples/index.html#intro)


## Goals

*  Screen to list events (can filter to just see the ones you're signed up for)
*  Screen to create an event
*  Screen to edit events (Master/Detail view)
*  Calendar that shows the events (can filter to show all or an individual's events)
*  Setup MongoDB or Firebase on the backend
*  Setup authorization
*  Setup event reminders
